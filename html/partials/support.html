          <div class="info-header middle">What is a Hosted Scp1310jp1 Account?</div>
          <div class="no-account-text thin middle">The service provides secure, hosted Scp1310jp1 accounts in order to provide easy access to funds for those that would prefer not to run a full Scp1310jp1 client themselves, or for those on devices with limited resources. You can access your account on any device, as long as you have access to your private login key. The service never knows your private login key, and is thus unable to spend your funds without your authorisation. All of the private cryptography is done locally on your device.</div>
